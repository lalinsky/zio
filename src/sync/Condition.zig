//! A condition variable for coordinating async tasks.
//!
//! Condition variables allow tasks to wait for certain conditions to become true
//! while cooperating with other tasks. They are always used in conjunction with
//! a Mutex to protect the shared state being checked.
//!
//! This implementation is designed for the zio async runtime and provides
//! cooperative waiting that works with coroutines. When a coroutine waits on
//! a condition, it suspends and yields to the executor, allowing other tasks
//! to run.
//!
//! The standard pattern for using a condition variable is:
//! 1. Lock the mutex
//! 2. Check the condition in a loop
//! 3. If condition is false, wait on the condition variable (this atomically
//!    releases the mutex and suspends)
//! 4. When woken, the mutex is automatically reacquired
//! 5. Loop back to check condition again
//! 6. Once condition is true, proceed with work
//! 7. Unlock the mutex
//!
//! Wait operations are cancelable. If a task is cancelled while waiting,
//! the mutex will be reacquired before the error is returned, maintaining
//! the invariant that wait() always holds the mutex on return.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```zig
//! var mutex: zio.Mutex = .init;
//! var condition: zio.Condition = .init;
//! var ready = false;
//!
//! // Waiter task
//! try mutex.lock(rt);
//! defer mutex.unlock(rt);
//! while (!ready) {
//!     try condition.wait(rt, &mutex);
//! }
//! // ... proceed with work ...
//!
//! // Signaler task
//! try mutex.lock(rt);
//! ready = true;
//! mutex.unlock(rt);
//! condition.signal(rt);
//! ```
